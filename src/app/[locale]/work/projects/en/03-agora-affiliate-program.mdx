I was responsible for the **entire full-stack development** of the project, including:

- **Frontend (React.js)**: Built interactive user interfaces for adding, editing, and managing imported Amazon products.
- **Backend (Node.js)**: Developed REST APIs for product fetching, review imports, and metafield management.
- **Amazon PAAPI Integration**: Used the Product Advertising API to fetch structured product details from Amazon.
- **Theme App Extensions**: Enabled merchants to display reviews and product info dynamically within their Shopify themes.
- **Metafield Management**: Handled metafields using Shopify Admin GraphQL APIs to store and retrieve Amazon-related metadata.
- **Plan-Based Restrictions**: Implemented tiered access to features such as page-based review loading and variant limits based on user plans.
