## Introduction

**Genie Pickup** is a custom Shopify app that allows merchants to offer **pickup locations** during checkout. Developed with a React frontend and a Ruby backend, it integrates seamlessly into Shopify's theme using **Theme App Extensions**. You can explore the app on the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/store-pickup-by-genie-apps).

## Client Background

The client wanted to enhance their fulfillment strategy by letting customers select **pickup points** instead of relying solely on delivery. The app needed to provide both front-facing configuration and checkout integration while maintaining a native Shopify experience.

## Challenge

The main development challenges included:

- Creating an interface for **merchants to define pickup locations**.
- Integrating pickup logic into **Shopify's cart and checkout** processes.
- Building a system compatible with **Shopify's Theme App Extension model**.
- Supporting seamless UX without disrupting Shopify's default behavior.

## App Development

As the sole developer, I led the complete build of the app:

- **Frontend (React.js)**: Built merchant-facing UIs to manage pickup locations and display them on storefronts.
- **Backend (Ruby)**: Handled data storage, logic for pickup scheduling, and merchant configuration.
- **Theme App Extensions**: Used extensions to inject pickup location selectors into cart and checkout templates.
- **Full Architecture Design**: Designed and built the entire infrastructure for storage, settings management, and display logic.
- **Shopify Integration**: Ensured the app met all requirements for theme extensibility and merchant installability.

## Result

The app is now live and used by merchants to streamline local pickups. It has improved customer satisfaction by offering an alternative to shipping and enabled merchants to manage logistics more flexibly.

## Conclusion

**Genie Pickup** showcases the potential of Shopify theme extensions and custom backend logic to enhance store functionality. It empowers merchants to offer personalized delivery options that suit local business models.
